Array
------
#### Easy
##### 1. Two Num
    Just using iteration and will ac.
##### 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
    Please consider the case that input is null.  
    Using nums.empty() and return {} will be done.
##### 27. Remove Element
    A very clever method.  
    Using a index and just find the different number and replace it.
##### 35.Search Insert Position
    This question is very simple.  
    All you need to do is to consider the boundary cases.

String
------
#### Easy
##### 13. Roman to Integer
    Using a different thinking angle.  
    From left to right not right to left.  
    Try to using data structure like unordered_map.
##### 14. Longest Common Prefix
    This is a very simple question.
##### 20. Valid Parentheses
    Using stack and switch to solve it.  
    Remember stack.pop() and stack.top().
##### 28. Implement strStr()
    KMP!!!! Please figure out how to use KMP
##### 38. Count and Say
    Tips: How to count iterately and check equal continuely.  
    Using while(i + 1 < res.size() && res[i] == res[i + 1]).   
    to_string() to change int into string. 

Math
------
#### Easy
##### 7. Reverse Integer
    Do not always use x divide 10.  
    Please use res * 10 from zero to the number you want.
    INT_MAX is about 2^31.  
    INT_MIN is about 2^31.
    Pay attention to the remand, using long not int.
